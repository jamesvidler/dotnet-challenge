# .NET Backend Developer Challenge
Show us your ASP.NET skills with this developer challenge. 

We are looking for rockstar developers that know how to **KiSS** (Keep-it-Simple-Stupid), while building scalable solutions that can go the distance using the Microsoft technology stack.

## The Challenge
Build a *Web API* backend that supports adding and listing of **Comments** for a Blog website.


## Requirements
1. Must support an API call to **Add a Comment**
2. Must support an API call to **List all Comments** (Top candidates will implement pagination parameters)
3. For sake of brevity, added **Comments** can be stored in-memory (Top candidates will store these in a Database, Table Storage, or other persistent data storage)
4. API must be fully documented, you can use a README.MD file (Top candidates will also demonstrate usage of documentation tools such as Swagger/Swashbuckle)
5. Data model for **Comments** is entirely up to you (Comments are submitted anonymously, so you don't need to handle any logins or authentication)
6. Include a list of *Todos* on your README.MD file that details what else you might add to this more scalable. Think what will happen if this is used in a scenario where you get *millions* of requests?

## Technology Stack
- Must use ASP.NET MVC (.NET Framework) OR ASP.NET Core MVC 
- Bonus for deploying the web app to Azure or another cloud provider
 
## Submission
Once you are satisfied, please ensure you create a GitHub repo, with an appropriate README.MD file to run your project and the repo URL via email to your contact at Agility.

## Evaluation
You will be evaluated on the following:
- Demonstration of basic ASP.NET MVC concepts
- You met the basic requirements
- The quality of your code
- Ability to document your GitHub Repo and API effectively
- Your thoughts on how to make it more scalable
- Going the extra-mile to demonstrate your skills or willingness to learn
